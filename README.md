# Blue Team Labs

Welcome to the **Blue Team Labs** repository! This project is a collection of hands-on exercises and investigations designed to sharpen my skills in **Defensive Cybersecurity (Blue Teaming)** using industry-standard tools like **Splunk**, **Wireshark**, **Nmap**, and **TCPDump**.

Each folder in this repository represents a lab or real-world inspired investigation using logs, packets, or command-line tools to detect and understand malicious activity.

## Repository Structure

## Completed Labs

| Tool        | Lab Name            | Description                                     |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Splunk      | Apache Logs         | Detects suspicious web access patterns          |
| Splunk      | SSH Brute Force     | Identifies multiple failed login attempts       |
| Splunk      | DNS Logs            | Analyzes suspicious domain queries              |
| Splunk      | Windows Event Logs  | Analyze windows logs for failed logins          |

(More tools and labs will be added )

## Tools Used

- **Splunk**: For centralized log analysis and dashboards.
- **Wireshark**: To inspect packet captures and spot anomalies.
- **Nmap**: For scanning, reconnaissance, and enumeration.
- **TCPDump**: For lightweight command-line packet analysis.
- *(More to come...)*

## Goal

- Build practical blue team skills
- Showcase projects on GitHub
- Secure a hands-on **cybersecurity internship**
- Eventually target **30 LPA security roles** before the 8th semester

## Status

This repository is actively maintained as part of my personal blue team learning.  
I’ll continue to update it as I complete more practical labs and investigations.
