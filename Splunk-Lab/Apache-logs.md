This repository contains hands-on Splunk log analysis projects focusing on log ingestion, visualization, and threat detection â€” especially relevant for Blue Team cybersecurity learning.

Project 1: Apache Logs

Objective: Analyzed Apache HTTP server logs using Splunk, extract meaningful insights like top IP addresses, most requested resources, and HTTP status distribution, and visualize the data using a custom dashboard.

Tools Used: Splunk Enterprise (local installation), Apache access logs (`apache_logs.log`)

Steps Performed

1. Log Upload:
- Uploaded `apache_logs.log` into Splunk via GUI

2. SPL Queries Executed:

ðŸ”¹ Top 10 IP Addresses

index=test_logs 
| stats count by clientip 
| sort -count 
| head 10

ðŸ”¹ Most Requested URLs

index=test_logs 
| stats count by uri_path 
| sort -count 
| head 10

ðŸ”¹ HTTP Status Code Distribution

index=test_logs | stats count by status | sort -count

3. Dashboard Creation: Created a dashboard named Apache Log Insights with:

Top 10 IPs, Top requested URLs, HTTP status code distribution chart
